# widget-editor

This repository contains the code of the widget editor used in [Resource Watch](https://github.com/resource-watch/resource-watch) and [PREP](https://github.com/resource-watch/prep-app).

Initially developped for RW, the editor was then needed for PREP so it has been extracted in this repository. While exposing the React component by default, the package also contains a suite of components, services and styles that it needs and that can be re-used in other apps.

## Get started

The widget editor needs a [React](https://reactjs.org) environment with [Redux](https://redux.js.org), as well as needs some peer dependencies to be installed:
```bash
$ yarn add react react-dom prop-types redux react-redux redux-thunk leaflet vega@^2.6.5
$ yarn add widget-editor
```

You can [check the release tab](https://github.com/resource-watch/widget-editor/releases) on Github to see what is the most recent version.

*NOTE: you can either use npm or yarn.*

Your app must configure Redux' store so it uses the editor's reducers and [react-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk):
```js
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import ReduxThunk from 'redux-thunk';
import { reducers } from 'widget-editor';

let store = createStore(
  combineReducers(reducers),
  {},
  applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk)
);
```

The reducers are: `widgetEditorExplore`, `widgetEditorModal`, `widgetEditorTooltip` and `widgetEditor`.

Finally, the library contains some external images you need to include in your build process. In your [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) configuration file, please add the following:
```js
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new CopyWebpackPlugin([
      {
        from: { glob: 'node_modules/widget-editor/dist/images/**/*', to: 'images' }
      }
    ])
  ]
};
```

And don't forget to install the dev dependency:
```bash
$ yarn add copy-webpack-plugin --dev
```


### Configuration

You need to configure the library before using any of its components or services. You don't need to to it everytime you instance a new editor, so you can do it in your app's main file.

For example, here is how we do it in RW:
```js
import { setConfig } from 'widget-editor';

// Change the configuration according to your needs
setConfig({
  url: 'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1',
  env: 'production,preproduction',
  applications: 'rw',
  authUrl: 'https://api.resourcewatch.org/auth'
});
```

Here are all the options you can set:

Name | Default value | Mandatory | Description
-----|---------------|-----------|------------
`url: string` | `undefined` | Yes | Base URL of the API
`env: string` | `undefined` | Yes | Environment of the API (comma-separated string)
`applications: string` | `undefined` | Yes | Applications of the API (comma-separated string)
`authUrl: string` | `undefined` | Yes | URL to authenticate the user
`userToken: string` | `null` | No | Token of the logged user
`userEmail: string` | `null` | No | Email of the logged user
`locale: string` | `"en"` | No | Locale used to fetch the data

## How to use the `WidgetEditor` component

### Setup

In addition to the editor's component, you must also include a few others needed to display the tooltips for example, as well as include the stylesheet.

The minimal setup is the following:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import WidgetEditor, { Modal, Tooltip, Icons, setConfig } from 'widget-editor';
import 'widget-editor/dist/styles.css';

// Change the configuration according to your needs
setConfig({
  url: 'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1',
  env: 'production,preproduction',
  applications: 'rw',
  authUrl: 'https://api.resourcewatch.org/auth'
});

const App = props => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Modal />
      <Tooltip />
      <Icons />
      <WidgetEditor datasetId="XXX" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Props

Below is the list of props the `WidgetEditor` component takes:

Name | Default value | Mandatory | Description
-----|---------------|-----------|------------
`datasetId: string` | `undefined` | Yes | The ID of the dataset to load the data from
`widgetId: string` | `undefined` | No | If provided, the ID of the widget to edit
`saveButtonMode: string` | `"auto"` | No | If `"auto"`, the save/update button only appears if a user token is passed to the configuration. If `"always"`, the button is always shown. If `"never"`, the button never appears. **(*)**
`titleMode: string` | `"auto"` | No | If `"auto"`, the title is only editable if a user token is passed to the configuration. If `"always"`, the title is always editable. If `"never"`, it is always fixed.
`onSave: function` | `undefined` | No | Callback executed when the user clicks the save/update button.
`provideWidgetConfig: function` | `undefined` | No | Callback which is passed a function to get the widget configuration (see below)

**(*)** The button is **never** shown a widget hasn't been rendered yet.

### Get the widget config

Once the user has created a widget and clicks the save button, you'll probably want to save it somewhere. In order to get the configuration of the widget, you need to pass a callback function to the editor as the prop `provideWidgetConfig`. This callback will receive as sole parameter a function to call to retrieve the widget config.

```jsx
let getWidgetConfig;

const App = props => {
  return (
    <WidgetEditor
      datasetId="XXX"
      provideWidgetConfig={(func) => { getWidgetConfig = func; }}
    />
  );
};
```

Once the editor has been mounted, `getWidgetConfig` can be used to retrieve the widget config:
```js
getWidgetConfig()
  .then((widgetConfig) => {
    // Here you are: ðŸ“Š
  })
  .reject(() => {
    // Either the user hasn't created a widget yet or the process
    // failed to retrieve its configuration
  });
```

For more information about the `widgetConfig` object, take a look at [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/resource-watch/notebooks/blob/master/ResourceWatch/Api_definition/widget_definition.ipynb).


## How to use the `Modal` component
If you want to re-use the editor's modal in your app, you need to include the component within a non-positioned container (at the root for example). You can then open it with any content using its [redux' actions](https://github.com/resource-watch/widget-editor/blob/master/src/reducers/modal.js).

Your root component should look like this:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Modal } from 'widget-editor';

const App = props => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Modal />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## How to use the `Tooltip` component
Similarly to the `Modal` component, you can use the editor's tooltip inside your app by putting it in a root component (non-relatively positioned). Check out its [actions](https://github.com/resource-watch/widget-editor/blob/master/src/reducers/tooltip.js) to see how to open it.

Your root component should contain:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Tooltip } from 'widget-editor';

const App = props => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Tooltip />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Exposed code

In addition to these 3 components, a dozen others and a few helper/services functions are exposed through the library. You can [see the whole list here](https://github.com/resource-watch/widget-editor/blob/master/index.js).

## Contribute
If you'd like to contribute to the project, clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:resource-watch/widget-editor.git
```

Then, install the dependencies:
```bash
$ cd widget-editor && yarn
```

You need to run two terminals to start coding. The first one will watch for the source code and compile it:
```bash
$ yarn watch
```

The second will contain the server that let's you test the editor:
```bash
$ yarn start
```
Once you've executed the command, your browser should open with a basic testing page.

In you're favorite text editor, you can find the source code in `/src` and the testing file `/test.js`.

If you want to analyze the library's bundle, you can also run:
```bash
$ yarn analyze
```
which will open a server on the port 8888.
